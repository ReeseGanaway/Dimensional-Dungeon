#Dimensional Dungeon

Hi everyone! Here is the github repo for the fullstack web game I'm currently working on Dimensional Dungeon. Its a turn-based tactical rpg where players can choose some of their favorite superheroes to fight some ai enemies.

The game as it currently exists is deployed now on netlify at https://dimensional-dungeon.netlify.app/!

Current features

<ul>
<li>Team Selection: Players can choose 4 characters from a pool of character to have on their team </li>
<li>Character Movement: Players can move characters around the map, which is a 10 by 10 grid</li>
<li>Character Stats: Each character has its own stats, for example, each character has a "move range" that determines how many squares in the grid they can travers in one turn</li>
<li>Enemy Ai: Enemies will move towards the ally character with the highest damage on each turn</li>
<li>Turn System: When every character on a team has been used during a turn, the game will allow the other team to make their moves</li>
</ul>
